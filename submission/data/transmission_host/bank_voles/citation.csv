Many sites are monitored using nestboxes which the animals utilise and anyone opening these nestboxes and disturbing dormice needs to hold a licence from Natural England or Natural Resources Wales to do so. At this time the data provider believes that full location disclosure to the public could lead to environmental harm. This sensitive information may be made available under licence to specific organisations and individuals that need to know to avoid harm to the environment. 

Furthermore disclosure of this information would adversely affect the interests of the persons who contributed to the dataset. The providers are not under any legal obligation to supply the information to the public through the NBN Atlas and they may have not consented to its wider release.
